# Semantic Textual Relatedness
Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) refers to the degree to which two pieces of text (usually sentences or short passages) share the same meaning or convey similar information. The goal is to measure how semantically similar two texts are, regardless of their surface-level differences (like word choice or sentence structure).

For example, the sentences:

"The dog is running in the park."
"A dog is jogging in the park."
These two sentences might use different words ("running" vs. "jogging") but convey essentially the same meaning, so they would be considered highly semantically similar.
